# Description 
This is my first javascript project. Pig-Game was created using Jonas Schmedtmann course. 

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS
* JAVASCRIPT 

## Rules
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his round score.
* If player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
